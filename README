My config files for macOS.

Dotfiles are managed from the `install` script.

This repo was created for my personal use and is
updated very frequently, but feel free to pick
whatever you want.

Use at your own risks and please create back-ups
of your current set-up if you intend to use the
Makefile.

Download:

  git clone --recursive https://github.com/smallwat3r/dotfiles.git

Main commands (from repo):

  make            # install everything
  make dotfiles   # do all symlinks + cask/brew installs

Note: on first time use, if on macos you might not
have make installed, run (from repo):

  ./bin/homebrew-install && brew install make
