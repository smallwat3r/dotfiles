Feel free to pick whatever you want from this repo, but note it has been mostly
created for my personal use and its updated very frequently. Use at your own risks
and please create back-ups of your current set-up if you intend to use the Makefile.
Be aware these dotfiles are intended to be used on macOS, but most of it should
work as well in other Unix/Linux environments. Dotfiles are managed by GNU Stow.
