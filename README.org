* smallwat3r's dotfiles

Personal dotfiles managed with [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][GNU Stow]].

Feel free to reuse any part of this repository, but note that it is tailored to my own workflow and updated frequently. Back up your existing setup before using the provided Makefile.

** Requirements

- [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][GNU Stow]]

** Installation

Clone into your home directory:

#+begin_src shell
git clone https://github.com/smallwat3r/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
#+end_src

Stow all dotfiles (the Makefile detects the OS and selects the appropriate targets):

#+begin_src shell
cd ~/dotfiles && make stow
#+end_src

Other available commands:

#+begin_src shell
make unstow     # remove all symlinks
make dry-run    # preview changes without modifying the filesystem
make dconf-load # load dconf settings (Fedora only)
make help       # list available commands
#+end_src

** Structure

These configurations support multiple platforms:

| Directory | Description                                           |
|-----------+-------------------------------------------------------|
| ~base~    | Shared configs, always applied (zsh, Emacs, SSH, etc) |
| ~macos~   | macOS-specific overrides                              |
| ~fedora~  | Fedora-specific overrides                             |

Platform directories may contain a ~_root/~ subdirectory for system-level configs
(e.g. udev rules, launchd plists). These are stowed to ~/~ with sudo.

** Emacs

I use Emacs 30.x with a [[https://github.com/smallwat3r/emacs][vanilla configuration]].
The Emacs config is managed separately (not via stow) to allow direct development.

*** Installing Emacs

**** macOS

#+begin_src shell
brew tap d12frosted/emacs-plus && brew install emacs-plus@30
#+end_src

**** Fedora

#+begin_src shell
sudo dnf install emacs
#+end_src

*** Setting up the Emacs config

Clone the config and symlink it to =~/.emacs.d=:

#+begin_src shell
git clone https://github.com/smallwat3r/emacs.git ~/.config/smallwat3r-emacs
ln -s ~/.config/smallwat3r-emacs ~/.emacs.d
#+end_src

*** Historical Doom Emacs Config

I previously used [[https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs][Doom Emacs]].
The old configuration is preserved in [[file:base/.doom.d][base/.doom.d]] for reference, but is no longer
actively used.
