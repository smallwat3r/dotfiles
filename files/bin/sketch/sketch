$version

$self is a small productivity tool to rapidly generate and
access draft files from the terminal.

You can create a sketchrc file to configure sketch.

.sketchrc directory location by priority order:
  $\XDG_CONFIG_HOME/.sketchrc
  $\HOME/.config/.sketchrc
  $\HOME/.sketchrc

SKETCH_EDITOR: sketch default editor, if not set, check for
\$EDITOR if global env vars, if not set, default to vim.

SKETCH_ARCHIVES: archived files folder from where your sketch
files will be archived.

.sketchrc example file:
  # Sketch editor (vim, nvim, subl, emacs, nano etc)
  SKETCH_EDITOR=vim
  # Archived file folder.
  # Default locations:
  #   - $\XDG_DATA_HOME/sketch_archives
  #   - $\HOME/.local/share/sketch_archives
  SKETCH_ARCHIVES=$\HOME/.sketch_archives

}

_usage() {
  cat <<EOF
Usage:
  $self            creates a new draft file.

  $self <number>   open archived saved file. Ex:
                    $self 1 will reopen the last saved file.
                    $self 2 will reopen the previous one
                    etc...

  $self ls         list all archived files.

  $self purge      delete all the archived files.

Options:
  -h, --help        show help and exit.
  -u, --usage       show usage and exit.
  -v, --version     script version.
