# Disable RAOP (AirPlay) network audio discovery.
# This module auto-discovers AirPlay-compatible devices on the local network
# and creates audio sinks for them, which generates "new sink" notifications
# via mako whenever devices appear/disappear.
# To re-enable: delete this file and run `systemctl --user restart pipewire`
