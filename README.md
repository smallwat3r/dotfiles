My config files for macOS.  

Dotfiles are managed from the `install` script.  

This repo was created for my personal use and is 
updated very frequently, but feel free to pick 
whatever you want.  

Use at your own risks and please create back-ups 
of your current set-up if you intend to use the 
Makefile.  

```sh
# Main commands:

make            # install everything
make dotfiles   # do all symlinks + cask/brew installs
```
